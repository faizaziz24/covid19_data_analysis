# Welcome

Welcome to COVID19 Data Visualization using Python. This is a project-based which should take approximately 2 hours to finish. Before diving into the project, please take a look at the project objectives and structure:

# Project Objectives
In this project, we are going to focus on 3 learning objectives:

1. Learn to use visualization to answer to some analytical questions
2. Learn to use different graphs needed to illustrate insights in your dataset
3. Learn to use Plotly module in python

# Project Structure
The hands on project on COVID19 Data Visualization using Python is divided into following tasks:

## Task 1: Introduction
Understanding the purpose of the project, the dataset that will be used, and the questions that will be answered with the analysis

## Task 2: Visualizing Global Spread of COVID-19 from first day of the Pandemic
Using Choropleth map to Visualize Global Spread of COVID-19 from the first day of the pandemic

## Task 3: Visualizing how intensive the Covid19 Transmission has been in each country
Using a Bar chart to compare different countries in terms of How massive the Spread of the virus has been in there.

## Task 4: COVID19 spread before and after lockdown in Italy
Visualizing the impact of the national lockdown in Italy on the spread of the virus.

## Task 5: Deaths Rate Before and After national Lockdown in Italy
Visualizing the impact of the national lockdown in Italy on the death rate.
